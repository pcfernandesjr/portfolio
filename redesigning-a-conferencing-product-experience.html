          <p> As a one of the oldest telecom companies of the World, BT 
        has witnessed and being integral part of its evolution from 
        the beginning. With the advent of voIP technology, they 
        created their product oriented to provide this service to 
        medium and big companies. That’s how BT Conferencing 
        was born.
        </br></br>
        However, soon video meetings, and also webRTC came, and 
        BT’s answer was using a 3rd party solution for video - 
        Webex - created by Cisco, while using their audio 
        technology. From the user point of view, that provided a 
        poor experience, since you had to utilize two different 
        services to have the complete experience with audio and 
        video-sharing.
        </br></br>
        After some years Cisco announced that Webex would be 
        discontinued, forcing BT to make their move. This scenario 
        brought the opportunity for us to propose a wholesome 
        service, that would make BT able to compete with other 
        solutions such as Zoom or BlueJeans.
        </p>
        </br>
        <h4 class="section-title"> Challenges </h4>

        <p>The short time we had was the first factor that made this 
        project challenging. Our client had only a couple of months 
        to have a new solution ready, and to take care of 
        transitioning their customers to it. We had to act fast and 
        use our time as intelligent as possible. We gathered 
        requirements and information about their business, clients, 
        and also the pain points we should pay attention to.
        </br></br>
        The stakeholders were pretty adamant into offering a ‘in 
        your face’ UI. We had to thread carefully into balancing 
        things out since time was precious, and there was other 
        issues that needed attention as well. Another challenge was 
        designing the process of hosting and joining a meeting the 
        most minimalistic as possible.
        </p>
        </br>
        <h4 class="section-title"> Solutions </h4>

        <p>The first step was agreeing upon developing a Proof-of-
        Concept version and documenting the user flows, taking 
        special care with the ‘sign in’ process for both hosts and 
        participant cases. We noticed that there were some 
        information that wasn’t exactly required to allow 
        participants to join, such as e-mail, so we managed to strip 
        down the required credentials to the essential.
        </br></br>
        We divided the home screen interface three segments: User 
        details and menu, Host and Joining, and Sound/Voice quick 
        configuration. These are the essentials needed to setup 
        your headset and  join a meeting. We also added as a 
        suggestion the option to save frequent meetings, so users 
        can quickly join without requiring to input information 
        in every session.
        </br></br>
        The decision behind the Meeting screen was based in 
        providing something that should be familiar to users, since 
        people from different backgrounds and levels of tech 
        savviness will utilize it. The features are displayed in a bar 
        placed in the bottom of the screen, while the rest of the 
        space is all about the meeting, the users and what they will 
        present.
        </br></br>
        Unfortunately it wasn’t possible for me to continue on this 
        project. But I am curious to see what will become of it.
