                    <p class="observation">Disclaimer: Since I worked under NDA clausules, I am not allowed to present mockups delivered to clients. However, to have something to present, I made some adjustments, ommiting and blurrying out sensible information.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p> This was a really interesting project as it strayed away from what is currently seen regularly in IT projects. I had the privilege to work as a UI designer for a biometry software redesign, used to capture fingerprints, facial features and other body marks such as tattoos, scars, etc. This sofware comes bundled with scanners used in several locations such as airports and police stations.
                    </p>
                    </br>

                    <h4 class="section-title"> Challenges </h4>

                    <p>Our client commissioned us the software redesign due several complaints from employees, and also from research data exposing issues into the efficiency of the service stations.
                        <br>
                        <br> Since there is a high rate of turnover for employees that operate these devices, our customer often needs to spend resources and time with training, besides the hiring process. One of the key requirements was focusing on making it easy to be used by anyone. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h4 class="section-title"> Solutions </h4>
                    <p>In order to create the mockups I had to learn how to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Blend" target="blank">Microsoft Blend</a>, a tool that comes with Visual Basic. That helped the developers to apply the visual design way faster than only providing mockups and separate assets, since we all had only a shared project that could be accessed by the whole team at the same time. The UI had to be intuitive enough to be possible for any person to conduct a capture session. Working together with the UX team, we defined a group of principles:
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Linearity: Avoiding to give many branching options to the user. Moving back/towards and restarting the process would be the only navigational tools.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Location and Navigation: Users must always know in which step of the process they are. So we need to provide the means to make it possible.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Clear Feedback: Our design must inform any issues and list possible solutions to overcome it as clearly as possible.
                        </br>
                        <br>
                        At the moment I joined the team, most of the research phase was already done, and some sketches and low fidelity wireframes created in Balsamiq were available. I provided input on the user flow and the wireframes, proposing some changes to make the experience less overwhelming. These are some of the screens prior my UI design work:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img class="article-image" src="vendor\img\articles\article_03\layout_before.PNG" alt="First Layout">
                        <!-- (IMG: First Layout) -->
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img class="article-image" src="vendor\img\articles\article_03\layout_before2.PNG" alt="Layout after my review">
                        <!-- (IMG: Layout after my review) -->
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And how the screens changed after the UI design process:
                        <img class="article-image" src="vendor\img\articles\article_03\layout_after.PNG" alt="First Layout">
                        <!-- (IMG: First Layout) -->
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img class="article-image" src="vendor\img\articles\article_03\layout_after2.PNG" alt="Layout after my review">
                        <!-- (IMG: Layout after my review) -->
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Included in this process are also the typeface, color palette and iconography definitions. We decided to keep things visually simple using a Flat aesthetic, and the same pragmatism is reflected with the typeface selected, Segoe UI.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img class="article-image" src="vendor\img\articles\article_03\typeface.PNG" alt="Typography">
                        <!-- (IMG: Layout after my review) -->
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img class="article-image" src="vendor\img\articles\article_03\color_palette.PNG" alt="Color Palette">
                        <!-- (IMG: Layout after my review) -->
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img class="article-image" src="vendor\img\articles\article_03\icons.PNG" alt="Icon Set">
                        <!-- (IMG: Layout after my review) -->
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The wireframes used for testing, displayed a great amount of controls and visual elements. I proposed another change by breaking down the process into smaller steps.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img class="article-image" src="vendor\img\articles\article_03\process_before.PNG" alt="Process before">
                        <!-- (IMG: Layout after my review) -->
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img class="article-image" src="vendor\img\articles\article_03\process_after.PNG" alt="Process after">
                        <!-- (IMG: Layout after my review) -->
                        <br>
                        <br>  
                        That way users would be able to focus on configuring and selecting options related to one parameter at time. Making it as guided and straightforward as possible, we could ensure that anyone would be able to use the software. The work we delivered was highly praised by our client. That and being able to work with an amazing team made this an awesome project to participate on.
