                        <p class="observation">Disclaimer: Since I worked under NDA clausules, I am not allowed to present
                            mockups delivered to clients. However, to have something to present, I
                            redesigned some layouts, also doing some adjustments and blurrying out
                            sensible information.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>I was recruited to lead the UX work for a project that aimed on making
                            our customer to be in equal foot with other webRTC applications. They relied
                            on third-party solutions to provide video-sharing capabilities, implemented
                            in a way that provided a poor experience since you had to utilize two different
                            services to have audio and video properly working.</p>
                        <br>
                         <h4 class="section-title"> Challenges </h4>
                        <p>The short time available was the first factor that made this project challenging.
                            Our client had only a couple of months to have a new solution ready, and
                            to take care of transitioning their customers to it. My first concern was
                            thinking on how to use our time as intelligent as possible. I started gathering
                            requirements and information about their business, clients, and also the
                            pain points we should pay attention to. That helped drafting some user
                            stories as well.
                            <br>

                            <img class="article-image" src="vendor/img/articles/article_01/art_img_requirements.jpg"
                            alt="Requirement List">
                            <!-- (IMG: Requirement List / Users) -->
                            <br>
                            <br>The stakeholders were pretty adamant into offering a &#x2018;in your face&#x2019;
                            UI. We had to thread carefully into balancing things out since time was
                            precious, and there was other issues that needed attention as well. Another
                            challenge was designing the process of hosting and joining a meeting the
                            most minimalistic as possible.</p>

                        alt="User Flow Example">
                        <!-- (IMG: User-Flows) -->
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                         <h4 class="section-title"> Solutions </h4>
                        <p>The first step was agreeing upon developing a Proof-of-Concept version
                            and documenting the user flows, taking special care with the &#x2018;sign
                            in&#x2019; process for both hosts and participant cases. I noticed that
                            there were some information that wasn&#x2019;t exactly required to allow
                            participants to join, such as e-mail, so we ended up deciding to strip
                            down the required credentials to the essential.
                            <br>
                            <br>I planned to divide the home screen interface in three segments: User
                            details and menu, Host and Joining, and Sound/Voice quick configuration.
                            These are the essentials needed to setup your headset and join a meeting.
                            In addition, a suggested feature was the option to save frequent meetings,
                            so users can quickly join without requiring to input information again
                            and again.
                            <br>

                            <!-- (IMG: Main Screen) -->
                            <br>
                            <br>The decision behind the Meeting screen was based in providing something
                            that should be familiar to users, since people from different backgrounds
                            and levels of tech savviness will utilize it. The features are displayed
                            in a bar placed in the bottom of the screen, while the rest of the space
                            is all about the meeting, the users and what they will present.

                            <br>My participation ended at this point. Gladly the Designs were approved
                            and the customers were very satisfied with my work. That allowed them to
                            have enough material to pitch the project to their superiors, while the
                            development team could manage to start working on the Proof-of-Concept.</p>
