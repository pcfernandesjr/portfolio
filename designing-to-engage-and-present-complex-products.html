                        <p class="observation">Disclaimer: Since I worked under NDA clausules, I am not allowed to present
                            mockups delivered to clients. However, to have something to present, I
                            redesigned some layouts, also doing some adjustments and blurrying out
                            sensible information.</p>

                        <p>Virtualization and Cloud computing solutions can become overwhelming or
                            confusing for most of the people to understand.
                            <br>
                            <br>Our client is among the biggest players in this industry, and willing
                            to make potential customers know their products better, they first commissioned
                            a test-drive portal where accredited users can try their products in already
                            configured test environments. The next step was providing a way to provide
                            an improved learning experience by offering tutorials and focused tasks
                            together with the product demos.</p>
                        <br>
                         <h4 class="section-title"> Challenges </h4>
                        <p>Our client is a big company with a great amount of internal competition,
                            which means that we need to comply to decision makers from several origins.
                            Units that might find interesting to have their solution featured in, helping
                            generate awareness and more business opportunities are also key players
                            on this.
                            <br>
                            <br>While the product&#x2019;s vision was being detailed and matured, the
                            UX team and I started working on some wireframes, so it could be easier
                            to visualize if we were going into the right direction or not, also facilitating
                            the process of finding problems and issues that we wouldn&#x2019;t be able
                            to foresee otherwise.
                            <br>

                            <br>In the end, this project&#x2019;s objective is still to design a tool
                            to generate sales. We needed to balance the experience enough to still
                            keep this objective and not drift too far into making it too similar to
                            an e-learning platform. Oh, and of course the biggest question: how to
                            make this an appealing experience to users?</p>
                        <br>
                         <h4 class="section-title"> Solutions </h4>
                        <p>We decided to invest time into organizing brainstorm sessions with teammates
                            from different areas, back-end, front-end, testing and support. This diverse
                            environment was important to gather a great amount of insights and technical
                            point of views that would help us solidify the upcoming design decisions.
                            <br>
                            <br>With the wireframing phase completed, we started to switch focus to the
                            visual design. I helped with researching options for a a grid system, deciding
                            in the end to follow 4 breakpoint widths (&gt;1280px, 960px, 640px and
                            320px) and a base of 4 vertical spacing and component size. By selecting
                            some screens that would use the most visual components to begin with, we
                            had our starting point to create our design system.
                            <br>

                            <!-- (IMG: Design System Example) -->
                            <br>
                            <br>After defining the design system, we started producing the screen mockups,
                            by having a common library created on Adobe XD, we could design pages as
                            a team without straying from a unified visual style. In order to guide
                            the developers I also created some screen flows so they could associate
                            the pages with their corresponding layouts.
                            <br>
                            <br>As an exercise, I designed an alternative layout to the portal&apos;s
                            home page, since I am not allowed to present it here:

                            <br>
                            <br>Having the possibility to work with a talented UX team such as this was
                            a blessing, allowing me to learn and trade knowledge throughout the period
                            I worked at it.</p>
